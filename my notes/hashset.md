**Hashset**

* A HashSet is a data structure used in computer science and programming that represents a collection of unique elements. 
It is typically used to store elements in such a way that retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations are efficient.

* In a HashSet, the elements are not ordered, meaning there is no specific sequence maintained for the elements stored within it. 
The primary advantage of a HashSet is that it provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element.

* Internally, a HashSet uses a hash table data structure to store its elements. This means that elements are stored based on their hash codes, 
which allows for fast retrieval and efficient storage.

* In most programming languages, including Java and C#, a HashSet ensures that it contains only unique elements, meaning duplicate elements are not allowed. 
When adding elements to a HashSet, the implementation checks whether the element already exists in the set based on its hash code and equality comparison. 
If the element is already present, the insertion operation typically fails.
